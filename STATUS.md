# Download Manager — DEVLOG

Working log for the continuous v1 push. Newest entries at the bottom.
SPEC.md is the contract. Reference PNGs are the visual target.
Where they conflict, SPEC wins (owner directive).

## 2026-09-03 — Baseline audit (codex greenfield drop)

Unzipped `downloadmanager.zip` (38 files) to `/srv/repos/downloadmanager/`.
Old `download-manager/`, `download-manager-redux/`, `download-manager.zip` untouched.

What exists:
- Frontend (`src/`): manager, rows, inspector (Overview/Network/Media/Files/Log),
  Settings tab (6 pages), Add Download window, extension popup surface,
  tray surface, notifications surface. Mock adapter with 14 sample jobs
  (`VITE_DATA_MODE=mock`). Real adapter via Tauri commands. Custom SVG icons.
- Rust core (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`, ~1100 lines): single instance, SQLite,
  provisional acquisition, whole-object multi-connection with range validation,
  single-stream fallback, HLS/DASH segments (`media.rs` + unit tests),
  FFmpeg finalize/mux, bandwidth throttle, retry, pause/resume, reattach,
  tray, notifications, native-host stdio protocol (--native-host, --capture,
  --policy), Windows registry registration + Run key.
- Missing: `extension/` source entirely (package.json + tauri.conf expect it).
  No git repo, no .gitignore. No STATUS file.

Reference-vs-SPEC conflicts found (SPEC wins, code already follows SPEC):
- Reference Add Download has "Add to List" → SPEC §7.2: no backlog action. Code omits it. Correct.
- Reference General has "Silent downloads" + "Default add-download behavior",
  Browser Integration has "When takeover succeeds" → SPEC §11.3: Add window
  always shows, no silent takeover. Code omits them. Correct.
- Reference sidebar has "Pending" → SPEC §10.1: Paused, no Pending. Code uses Paused. Correct.
- Reference Notifications has 3rd toggle (silent-download toasts) → SPEC §11.5: 2 toggles. Code has 2. Correct.
- Reference Network has bandwidth usage chart → SPEC §11.4: only if backed by
  real data. Code shows honest "not recorded" state. Acceptable; real session
  counters are a later improvement, never a fake chart.

Cross-platform directive (owner, 2026-09-03): product must work on Linux too,
not Windows-only. Windows-first, Linux must not be broken or stubbed.
Consequences: XDG paths, Linux native-host manifests (~/.config/*NativeMessagingHosts),
Linux autostart (.desktop), no Windows-only types in core logic.
